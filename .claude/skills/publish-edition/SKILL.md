description: Find the newest KKReckons newsletter artifact that isn't on the website yet, turn it into a site edition, check it, and open a preview for Krishnakanth to approve. Publishes only after he replies "publish". Use for the nightly routine, or when asked to "publish today's edition".

# Publish the day's KKReckons edition

Runs automatically at 8:53 pm and 11:53 pm Pacific, and whenever he asks to "publish today's edition".
On late nights the earlier run simply finds nothing new, so later runs (or his request) pick the edition up.

Krishnakanth writes each edition in his Claude Project and publishes it as a claude.ai artifact titled
`KKReckons, <Weekday>, <D> <Month> <YYYY>` (for example `KKReckons, Friday, 9 October 2026`).
The data it must contain is described in `docs/edition-format.md`.
This skill moves that artifact onto kkreckons.com. **Nothing goes live without his explicit approval.**

## 1. Find the new edition

1. `git fetch origin main` and start a branch from it. Use the branch this session was told to develop on;
   if none was given, use `edition/<YYYY-MM-DD>`.
2. List his artifacts (`Artifact` tool, `action: "list"`, `limit: 60`).
3. Keep titles matching `KKReckons, <Weekday>, <D> <Month> <YYYY>` exactly. Ignore everything else
   (company scorecards, "in about a minute" videos, older "Reddy Reckoner" titles, personal artifacts).
4. Convert each title's date to `YYYY-MM-DD` and drop dates already in `data/editions.json`.
   If two artifacts share a date, take the most recently updated one.
5. **Already waiting for approval?** If an open pull request already adds that date (titled
   `Add edition: …`), don't build it again. Send one short reminder with its preview link, unless
   you already reminded him about it in this conversation tonight, then stop.
6. **Nothing new?** Stop. Report "No new KKReckons edition found" in one line, with the newest date
   already on the site. Don't open a pull request.
7. If more than one date is new, publish each (oldest first) in the same pull request.

## 2. Build it

1. Read the artifact (`Artifact` tool, `action: "read"`, `url`). Copy the saved page to
   `public/editions/<YYYY-MM-DD>.html`.
   It must be a full HTML document containing `<script id="data">`. If it isn't, stop and say so;
   don't guess at content.
2. Add `"<YYYY-MM-DD>": { "artifact": "<artifact url>" }` to `data/edition-meta.json`, keeping the
   file's existing order (oldest first) and two-space indentation.
3. `npm ci` (first time in the session), then
   `CHROMIUM_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers/chromium npm run editions`.
   Only the new date's files should change in `data/` besides `data/editions.json`; investigate any
   other diffs before going on.
4. `npm run check -- <YYYY-MM-DD>`. Every story needs a source link, at least two summary points and a
   "why it matters".
   - Publishers listed as "bare domains": add a display name to `PUBLISHERS` in `lib/editions.ts`
     (and to `PAYWALLED` if the site usually needs a subscription).
   - Missing source links or thin summaries: **don't invent anything.** Search for the original article.
     If you find it, add the fix as a per-story override under `stories` in `data/edition-meta.json`
     (see the 2026-09-30 entry for the shape) and re-run `npm run editions`. List every fix you made
     in the pull request and in your message, so he can check them. Anything you can't fix stays
     listed as an open problem.
5. `npm run build` must pass.

## 3. Preview and ask for approval

1. Commit (`Add edition: <Weekday>, <D> <Month> <YYYY>`), push, and open a pull request against
   `main`. In its body, include:
   - the headline (`slice`)
   - the story count and reading time
   - the check results
   - every fix you made
2. Vercel builds a preview for the pull request. Get its URL from the pull request's head commit
   status (`https://api.github.com/repos/kkreddy79/kkreckons/commits/<sha>/status`, the `target_url`
   of the Vercel status) once the state reads `success`.
3. Send him one short message (and a push notification if that tool is available) with:
   - the edition date and headline
   - the preview link: `<preview url>/daily/<month>-<day>-<year>`
   - "All checks passed", or the list of open problems
   - "Reply **publish** to put it live, or tell me what to change."
4. Then stop and wait. **Don't merge on your own.**

## 4. On his reply

- **"publish"** (or a clear yes): merge the pull request (merge commit). Poll the merge commit's status
  until Vercel reports success. Then reply with the live link,
  `https://www.kkreckons.com/daily/<month>-<day>-<year>`, and note that Home now shows it.
- **Changes** (for example "drop story 4" or "fix the headline"): make small text fixes as overrides in
  `data/edition-meta.json` (`slice`, or `stories` keyed by title). For bigger changes, ask him to update
  the artifact in his Project, then re-read it. Rebuild, re-check, push, and send the new preview link.
- **"skip"**: close the pull request without merging.

## Rules

- Never change an edition's facts, numbers or wording beyond what he asks for, or a sourced fix you list.
- Never publish an edition with open problems unless he says to publish anyway.
- Keep commits and pull requests free of model names.
